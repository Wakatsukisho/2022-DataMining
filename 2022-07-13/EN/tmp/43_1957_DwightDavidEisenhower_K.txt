the price of peace
mr chairman mr vice president mr chief justice mr speaker members of my family and friends my countrymen and the friends of my country wherever they may be we meet again as upon a like moment four years ago and again you have witnessed my solemn oath of service to you
i too am a witness today testifying in your name to the principles and purposes to which we as a people are pledged
before all else we seek upon our common labor as a nation the blessings of almighty god and the hopes in our hearts fashion the deepest prayers of our whole people
may we pursue the right without self righteousness
may we know unity without conformity
may we grow in strength without pride in self
may we in our dealings with all peoples of the earth ever speak truth and serve justice
and so shall america in the sight of all men of good will prove true to the honorable purposes that bind and rule us as a people in all this time of trial through which we pass
we live in a land of plenty but rarely has this earth known such peril as today
in our nation work and wealth abound our population grows commerce crowds our rivers and rails our skies harbors and highways our soil is fertile our agriculture productive the air rings with the song of our industry rolling mills and blast furnaces dynamos dams and assembly lines the chorus of america the bountiful
this is our home yet this is not the whole of our world for our world is where our full destiny lies with men of all people and all nations who are or would be free and for them and so for us this is no time of ease or of rest
in too much of the earth there is want discord danger new forces and new nations stir and strive across the earth with power to bring by their fate great good or great evil to the free world future from the deserts of north africa to the islands of the south pacific one third of all mankind has entered upon an historic struggle for a new freedom; freedom from grinding poverty across all continents nearly a billion people seek sometimes almost in desperation for the skills and knowledge and assistance by which they may satisfy from their own resources the material wants common to all mankind
no nation however old or great escapes this tempest of change and turmoil some impoverished by the recent world war seek to restore their means of livelihood in the heart of europe germany still stands tragically divided so is the whole continent divided and so too is all the world
the divisive force is international communism and the power that it controls
the designs of that power dark in purpose are clear in practice it strives to seal forever the fate of those it has enslaved it strives to break the ties that unite the free and it strives to capture to exploit for its own greater power all forces of change in the world especially the needs of the hungry and the hopes of the oppressed
yet the world of international communism has itself been shaken by a fierce and mighty force: the readiness of men who love freedom to pledge their lives to that love through the night of their bondage the unconquerable will of heroes has struck with the swift sharp thrust of lightning budapest is no longer merely the name of a city; henceforth it is a new and shining symbol of man yearning to be free
thus across all the globe there harshly blow the winds of change and we though fortunate be our lot know that we can never turn our backs to them
we look upon this shaken earth and we declare our firm and fixed purpose the building of a peace with justice in a world where moral law prevails
the building of such a peace is a bold and solemn purpose to proclaim it is easy to serve it will be hard and to attain it we must be aware of its full meaning and ready to pay its full price
we know clearly what we seek and why
we seek peace knowing that peace is the climate of freedom and now as in no other age we seek it because we have been warned by the power of modern weapons that peace may be the only climate possible for human life itself
yet this peace we seek cannot be born of fear alone: it must be rooted in the lives of nations there must be justice sensed and shared by all peoples for without justice the world can know only a tense and unstable truce there must be law steadily invoked and respected by all nations for without law the world promises only such meager justice as the pity of the strong upon the weak but the law of which we speak comprehending the values of freedom affirms the equality of all nations great and small
splendid as can be the blessings of such a peace high will be its cost: in toil patiently sustained in help honorably given in sacrifice calmly borne
we are called to meet the price of this peace
to counter the threat of those who seek to rule by force we must pay the costs of our own needed military strength and help to build the security of others
we must use our skills and knowledge and at times our substance to help others rise from misery however far the scene of suffering may be from our shores for wherever in the world a people knows desperate want there must appear at least the spark of hope the hope of progress or there will surely rise at last the flames of conflict
we recognize and accept our own deep involvement in the destiny of men everywhere we are accordingly pledged to honor and to strive to fortify the authority of the united nations for in that body rests the best hope of our age for the assertion of that law by which all nations may live in dignity
and beyond this general resolve we are called to act a responsible role in the world great concerns or conflicts whether they touch upon the affairs of a vast region the fate of an island in the pacific or the use of a canal in the middle east only in respecting the hopes and cultures of others will we practice the equality of all nations only as we show willingness and wisdom in giving counsel in receiving counsel and in sharing burdens will we wisely perform the work of peace
for one truth must rule all we think and all we do no people can live to itself alone the unity of all who dwell in freedom is their only sure defense the economic need of all nations in mutual dependence makes isolation an impossibility; not even america prosperity could long survive if other nations did not also prosper no nation can longer be a fortress lone and strong and safe and any people seeking such shelter for themselves can now build only their own prison
our pledge to these principles is constant because we believe in their rightness
we do not fear this world of change america is no stranger to much of its spirit everywhere we see the seeds of the same growth that america itself has known the american experiment has for generations fired the passion and the courage of millions elsewhere seeking freedom equality and opportunity and the american story of material progress has helped excite the longing of all needy peoples for some satisfaction of their human wants these hopes that we have helped to inspire we can help to fulfill
in this confidence we speak plainly to all peoples
we cherish our friendship with all nations that are or would be free we respect no less their independence and when in time of want or peril they ask our help they may honorably receive it; for we no more seek to buy their sovereignty than we would sell our own sovereignty is never bartered among freemen
we honor the aspirations of those nations which now captive long for freedom we seek neither their military alliance nor any artificial imitation of our society and they can know the warmth of the welcome that awaits them when as must be they join again the ranks of freedom
we honor no less in this divided world than in a less tormented time the people of russia we do not dread rather do we welcome their progress in education and industry we wish them success in their demands for more intellectual freedom greater security before their own laws fuller enjoyment of the rewards of their own toil for as such things come to pass the more certain will be the coming of that day when our peoples may freely meet in friendship
so we voice our hope and our belief that we can help to heal this divided world thus may the nations cease to live in trembling before the menace of force thus may the weight of fear and the weight of arms be taken from the burdened shoulders of mankind
this nothing less is the labor to which we are called and our strength dedicated
and so the prayer of our people carries far beyond our own frontiers to the wide world of our duty and our destiny
may the light of freedom coming to all darkened lands flame brightly until at last the darkness is no more
may the turbulence of our age yield to a true time of peace when men and nations shall share a life that honors the dignity of each the brotherhood of all
