chief justice roberts vice president harris speaker pelosi leaders schumer mcconnell vice president pence my distinguished guests and my fellow americans this is america’s day

this is democracy’s day a day of history and hope of renewal and resolve through a crucible for the ages america has been tested anew and america has risen to the challenge today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause the cause of democracy the people the will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded

we’ve learned again that democracy is precious democracy is fragile at this hour my friends democracy has prevailed

from now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the capitol’s very foundation we come together as one nation under god indivisible to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries

as we look ahead in our uniquely american way: restless bold optimistic and set our sights on the nation we can be and we must be

i thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today i thank them from the bottom of my heart and i know i know the resilience of our constitution and the strength the strength of our nation as does president carter who i spoke with last night who cannot be with us today but whom we salute for his lifetime of service

i’ve just taken the sacred oath each of those patriots have taken the oath first sworn by george washington but the american story depends not on any one of us not on some of us but on all of us on we the people who seek a more perfect union

this is a great nation we are good people and over the centuries through storm and strife in peace and in war we've come so far but we still have far to go we press forward with speed and urgency for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities much to repair much to restore much to heal much to build and much to gain

few people in our nation’s history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we’re in now a once in a century virus that silently stalks the country it’s taken as many lives in one year as america lost in all of world war ii millions of jobs have been lost hundreds of thousands of businesses closed a cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us the dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer

the cry for survival comes from the planet itself a cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear and now a rise of political extremism white supremacy domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat

to overcome these challenges to restore the soul and secure the future of america requires so much more than words it requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: unity unity

in another january on new year’s day in 1863 abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation when he put pen to paper the president said and i quote: “if my name ever goes down into history it’ll be for this act and my whole soul is in it ”

my whole soul was in it today on this january day my whole soul is in this: bringing america together uniting our people uniting our nation and i ask every american to join me in this cause

uniting to fight the foes we face: anger resentment hatred extremism lawlessness violence disease joblessness and hopelessness with unity we can do great things important things we can right wrongs we can put people to work in good jobs we can teach our children in safe schools we can overcome the deadly virus we can reward reward work and rebuild the middle class and make health care secure for all we can deliver racial justice and we can make america once again the leading force for good in the world

i know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days i know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real but i also know they are not new our history has been a constant struggle between the american ideal that we all created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism nativism fear demonization have long torn us apart the battle is perennial and victory is never assured

through civil war the great depression world war 9/11 through struggle sacrifice and setbacks our better angels have always prevailed in each of these moments enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward and we can do that now history faith and reason show the way the way of unity we can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors we can treat each other with dignity and respect we can join forces stop the shouting and lower the temperature for without unity there is no peace — only bitterness and fury no progress — only exhausting outrage no nation — only a state of chaos

this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge and unity is the path forward and we must meet this moment as the united states of america if we do that i guarantee you we will not fail we have never ever ever ever failed in america when we’ve acted together

and so today at this time in this place let’s start afresh all of us let’s begin to listen to one another again hear one another see one another show respect to one another politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war and we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured

my fellow americans we have to be different than this america has to be better than this and i believe america is so much better than this just look around here we stand in the shadow of the capitol dome as was mentioned earlier completed amid the civil war when the union itself was literally hanging in the balance yet we endured we prevailed

here we stand looking out on the great mall where dr king spoke of his dream here we stand where 108 years ago at another inaugural thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote and today we marked the swearing in of the first woman in american history elected to national office: vice president kamala harris don’t tell me things can’t change



here we stand across the potomac from arlington cemetery where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace and here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people to stop the work of our democracy to drive us from this sacred ground

it did not happen it will never happen not today not tomorrow not ever not ever

to all those who supported our campaign i’m humbled by the faith you’ve placed in us to all those who did not support us let me say this: hear me out as we move forward take a measure of me and my heart if you still disagree so be it that’s democracy that’s america the right to dissent peaceably the guardrails of our republic is perhaps this nation’s greatest strength

yet hear me clearly: disagreement must not lead to disunion and i pledge this to you: i will be a president for all americans all americans and i promise you i will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did

many centuries ago st augustine a saint in my church wrote ★that a★ people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love defined by the common objects of their love what are the common objects we as americans love that define us as americans i think we know opportunity security liberty dignity respect honor and yes the truth

recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson there is truth and there are lies lies told for power and for profit and each of us has a duty and responsibility as citizens as americans and especially as leaders leaders who have pledged to honor our constitution and protect our nation to defend the truth and defeat the lies

look — i understand that many of my fellow americans view the future with fear and trepidation i understand they worry about their jobs i understand like my dad they lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling wondering: can i keep my health care can i pay my mortgage thinking about their families about what comes next i promise you i get it



but the answer is not to turn inward to retreat into competing factions distrusting those who don’t look like you or worship the way you do or don’t get their news from the same sources you do we must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue rural vs urban conservative vs liberal we can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts if we show a little tolerance and humility and if we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes as my mom would say just for a moment stand in their shoes because here’s the thing about life: there’s no accounting for what fate will deal you some days when you need a hand there are other days when we’re called to lend a hand that’s how it has to be that’s what we do for one another and if we are this way our country will be stronger more prosperous more ready for the future and we can still disagree



my fellow americans in the work ahead of us we’re going to need each other we need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter we’re entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus we must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation one nation

and i promise you this as the bible says: “weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning ” we will get through this together together

look folks all my colleagues i served with in the house of the senate up there we all understand the world is watching watching all of us today so here’s my message to those beyond our borders: ★america has been tested and we’ve come out stronger for it we will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again not to meet yesterday’s challenges but today’s and tomorrow’s challenges and we’ll lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example



we’ll be a strong and trusted partner for peace progress and security



look — you all know we’ve been through so much in this nation and my first act as president i’d like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those who we lost this past year to the pandemic those 400 000 fellow americans moms dads husbands wives sons daughters friends neighbors and co workers we will honor them by becoming the people and the nation we know we can and should be so i ask you let’s say a silent prayer for those who’ve lost their lives those left behind and for our country

amen

folks this is a time of testing we face an attack on our democracy and on truth a raging virus growing inequity the sting of systemic racism a climate in crisis america’s role in the world any one of these will be enough to challenge us in profound ways but the fact is we face them all at once presenting this nation with one of the gravest responsibilities we’ve had now we’re going to be tested are we going to step up all of us it’s time for boldness for there is so much to do and this is certain i promise you: we will be judged you and i by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era

will we rise to the occasion is the question will we master this rare and difficult hour will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children i believe we must i’m sure you do as well i believe we will and when we do we’ll write the next great chapter in the history of the united states of america the american story a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me it’s called “american anthem ” there’s one verse that stands out at least for me and it goes like this:

the work and prayers of a century have brought us to this day

what shall be our legacy what will our children say

let me know in my heart when my days are through

america america i gave my best to you

let add let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great nation if we do this then when our days are through our children and our children children will say of us: they gave their best they did their duty they healed a broken land

my fellow americans i close the day where i began with a sacred oath before god and all of you i give you my word i will always level with you i will defend the constitution i’ll defend our democracy i’ll defend america and i will give all all of you keep everything i do in your service thinking not of power but of possibilities not of personal interest but the public good and together we shall write an american story of hope not fear of unity not division of light not darkness a story of decency and dignity love and healing greatness and goodness may this be the story that guides us the story that inspires us and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history we met the moment democracy and hope truth and justice did not die on our watch but thrived that america secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world that is what we owe our forebears one another and generations to follow

so with purpose and resolve we turn to those tasks of our time sustained by faith driven by conviction devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts may god bless america and may god protect our troops thank you america
